# RepairGPT
## Python Program that utilizes Address Sanitizer with Open AI's ChatGPT API to identify problems in code and patch them
### TestCode folder contains test code used split into the 3 subfolders based on category and then further split based on original code or patches generated by RepairGPT
1. BufferOverflow
*Note that because of the way that RepairGPT is written as well as the limitations of AddressSanitizer is written that RepairGPT cannot currently handle files 3 - 5. However they were still used in the inital Vulnerability Detection testing.*
2. Memory Leak
3. Off By 1

Additionally there is a clean.c file that was used in testing RepairGPT

SecretKey.txt is for storing the OpenAI API key


# Loop.py
## How to run the example
0. add inside the .env file the OpenAI API key
1. navigate to Benchmarks/libtiff-cve-2016-5321/src
2. unzip the file and rename it simply libtiff
3. run the following command: `python Loop.py -b Benchmarks/libtiff-cve-2016-5321/commands/build.txt -c Benchmarks/libtiff-cve-2016-5321/commands/run.txt -r ./Benchmarks/libtiff-cve-2016-5321/report/stack_info.txt`

## Known Issues
1. as of 02/23 Loop.py runs correctly and it is able to apply a fix. With the current prompt the applied fix never solves the issue.
